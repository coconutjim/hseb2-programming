  <p><strong>Summary: </strong>
    This chapter is not a tutorial at all but a brief excursion into optics. It gives an overview over the human eye as a tool to perceive our world stereoscopically. It will also introduce those factors which are responsible for depth perception and which are further used to generate an artificial stereoscopic view in virtual reality environments. As the trick is to create and present a different image for each of your eyes, the last section will discuss the most popular technologies to get this done in a more or less simple way.

        <h2>Depth perception of human eyes</h2>
        <p> 
        There are two categories of depth perception, the monocular perception related to only one eye and the binocular 
        perception related to both eyes. 
        </p>
        <h2>Monocular depth perception</h2>

        There are some other attributes which help us to get a monocular depth perception, for example shadows or psychological aspects like 
        known sizes of common objects. You can get more detailed information about this topic in the internet.
        <h2>Binocular depth perception</h2>
        <ul><li><b>Parallax</b>: Each of our eyes sees a slightly different image of the world. This is because each eye is a separate camera which 
        grabs the environment from a different position. In the image below you see two eyes 
        focusing the black point. The <b>optical axes</b> show the alignment of the eyes and the projected point on the retinas. There is another 
        point in green which is also projected. Those points have the same distance <i>L</i> and <i>R</i> to the optical axes on both retinas, they 
        are <b>corresponding points</b>. Each point on the <b>horopter</b>, let's say a focus circle, has these characteristics. 
        Points which are in front or behind the horopter have different distances, <i>L'</i> and <i>R'</i>, to the optical axes on the retina. The difference 
        between <i>R</i> and <i>L</i> is the so called <b>disparity</b>, which is positive or negative dependent on the position in front or behind 
        the horopter. Points on the horopter have a disparity of 0.</li><li><b>Convergence</b>: The distance between our eyes is fixed but the angle depends on the distance of a focused object. If we watch 
        the clouds in the sky the eye orientation is nearly the same but when we look at a fly which sits on our nose, the left eye looks 
        more to the right and the right eye to the left, so we are squiting. This angle between the optical axes of both eyes, the convergence, gives our brain a hint 
        about the distance to an object.</li></ul>

        <h2>Depth generation in VR</h2>
        <p> 
        Generation of stereoscopic viewing in virtual reality environments depends mainly on the above described parallax and convergence, which go 
        hand in hand. On a projection plane two separate images are displayed, one for the left and one for the right eye. Therefore the scene must be 
        rendered from two different cameras, next to each other like the human eyes. A separation technique has to make sure that one eye receives 
        only one image but this issue is discussed in the next chapter. 
        </p>
        <p>
        As each eye receives its appropriate image, their optical axes have a specific 
        angle which yields to the convergence. The brain recognizes both points as the same point and interprets it as it was 
        behind the projection plane or in front of it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Parameters which affect the convergence are the distance to the projection plane which is called <b>zero parallax distance</b> and the 
        <b>eye distance</b>. With these parameters depth impression can be adjusted.

        <h2>Eye separation</h2>
        <p> 
        Different images for both eyes have to be generated, presented and redivided to the eyes. How these three steps are 
        performed depends on the chosen technology. Those are categorized into active and passive approaches. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Active eye separation means a presentation of left and right images one after each other with high frequency while the eyes 
        are alternately being shut in the same frequency by shutter glasses (see image below). The advantage is to see the original 
        images without reduction of colors or color spectrums. On the other hand you need hardware (graphics card, beamer) which is 
        able to display images in a high frequency of about 120 Hz as well as synchronisation with shutter 
        glasses.
        </p>

        <p>
        With passive stereo, images for the left and right eye are displayed simultaneously. A common approach is to separate color 
        channels in order to show the blue channel for the left eye and and the red channel for the right eye. A user wears glasses 
        that filter the red or blue channel away as you can see in the left image below. The big disadvantage is the corruption of proper 
        colors.
        </p>        
        <div class="imgContainer"><img src="farbtrennung.png" align="center"/><div class="imgCaption">Image: Eye separation by color</div></div>
        <p>
        A better approach in this direction is the technology of <a href="http://www.infitec.net/">Infitec</a>, which doesn't split 
        whole color channels but color spectrums in each channel. For each eye three different bands - for red, green and blue wavelenths - 
        are filtered, with the result to get a total of six bands: right eye red, right eye green, right eye blue, left eye red, left eye green and 
        left eye blue. The desired colors are not completely modified like in the color channel separation case, but only a few frequency 
        regions are lost instead of a whole color channel.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another concept of passive stereo is the separation by polarization filters. Light oscillates in different directions and a polarization 
        filter just filters light in a way to let only parts of the light in a specific direction come through. So, for one eye, vertical oscillating 
        and for the other, horizontal oscillating light is permitted. It's a simple solution as the filters are not very expensive and can be 
        easily put in front of a video beamer and into cheap paper glasses. The downside is a loss of brightness and interesting effects when 
        inclining the head. This effect can be reduced with <b>radial polarization</b> approaches instead of <b>horizontal and vertical</b>.
